Hello all! My name is Hannah Lyons. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's in Biochemistry, a minor in Computer Science, and a minor in Chemistry in May 2021. In August 2024, I completed my Master of Engineering in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Development and Applications at Virignia Tech. Below are links to a few projects I have worked on during my time as a graduate student!

I am super passionate about both front and back end web development (full stack), as well as general software development for desktop applications, etc.
