I am a Software Developer working for Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division. I work on an agile development team creating and improving features for a modeling and simulation software application. I am super passionate about front and back end web development (full stack), as well as general software development for desktop applications, etc. Please check out the [Blog](https://hannahl8.github.io/blog.html) page to see coding projects from both my personal and academic career.

<h3>Computer Science Minor</h3>

<p>I really liked biochemistry as a major (mostly just the chemistry classes), but I still wanted to broaden my knowledge! I realized I had enough open electives left to add a minor, and computer science was calling to me. The first class I ever took was an insane learning curve, but also an incredibly rewarding challenge. I knew after successfully completing that class, to have a career in the field of computer science would be beyond gratifying.</p>
