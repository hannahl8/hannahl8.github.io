Hello all! My name is Hannah Lyons. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's in Biochemistry, a minor in Computer Science, and a minor in Chemistry in May 2021. Since then I have been working full time as a Computer Scientist at Naval Surface Warefare Center Indian Head Division on the Modeling & Simulations Team. August 2023, I started working part time so I could pursue a Master of Engineering in Computer Science, also at Virignia Tech. Below are links to a few projects I have worked on during my career as a graduate student!

I am super passionate about both front and back end web development (full stack), as well as general software development for desktop applications, etc.
