# Overview

I completed this project as part of a User Interface Software course in my Master's program.

# Links to Repositories

[code](https://github.com/hannahl8/focal){target="_blank"}

# Website Link

After completing the initial HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the project, we learned how to upload our information to just a file system hosted by VT, so this [link](https://people.cs.vt.edu/hannahl8/cs5774/project3/homesignedout.html){\"target="_blank"} is purely a static site. Throughout the course we used Django to create a dynamic site, that is not hosted anywhere but the repository link has the most up to date code.

# Tech Stack
