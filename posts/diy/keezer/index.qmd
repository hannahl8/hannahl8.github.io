# Introduction

I just gotta show her off

# Materials and Cost

Unfortunately, I did not take any cheap routes for this build. I bought everything new.

You could definitely use an old chest freezer, buy used kegs, and find a cheaper tap tower on Amazon. A lot of these things could probably also be found used on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace.

So in total, I spent **\$1,073.91**! Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if I'm missing something here either. Let's just say this wasn't a cheap DIY and if this thing ever perishes I'll be quite devastated.

Now that there's everything laid out of what I purchased, lets get into my build process!

# Build Process

## Painting the Chest Freezer

Painting the chest freezer was definitely the easiest part. First I sanded the whole thing and put painters tape around the seal, drain hole, and the little green light that shows the freezer is on.

![](sanded_freezer.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Then I primed the freezer, I didn't prime the top because I wouldn't be painting that. I knew I was going to be adding the tabletop later on.

![](primed_freezer.jpg){fig-align="center"}

A day or two later I pained it this lovely blue color. The lid is also now removed because I was prepping for the tabletop to be added.

![](painted_freezer.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Connecting the Wooden Tabletop and the Freezer Lid

The first thing I had to do was drill a hole in the freezer lid, I used a hole saw to do this. Unfortunately, I drilled right through the wires that connected to the freezer light in the lid, but I carefully removed them so it wasn't an issue. And I didn't need the light anyways so I wasn't upset about it.

![](drilled_hole_freezer_lid.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Next I had to line up the hole in the freezer to the wooden piece. This was easy. I also added painters tape to show where the freezer lid will go.

![](wooden_lid_hole_align.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Here I laid out the 1/2" washers to go in between the wood and the freezer lid. This was because the lid had the smallest dip on the edges raising it, and I needed this lid to be as secure as possible to the wood.

![](wooden_lid_hole_washers.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Finally here's everything glued on to the wood and ready to have to freezer lid placed on top.

![](wooden_lid_glue.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Here's the lid glued on and with additional washers that I screwed through the freezer lid into the wood. I let this set for at least 48 hours before messing with it.

![](glued_lid_to_wood_and_screwed_in.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Finishing the Wooden Tabletop

I had to add tabletop edges to this thing. Let me tell you, using a table saw to cut 45 degree angled edges was not easy! And table saws are actually terrifying. Here I have the three pieces of wood ready to to be attached and make this baby look more elegant.

![](prepping_tabletop_edges.jpg){fig-align="center"}

So I am silly and only bought gray glue. I should have gotten one that matched the stain I was going to use, but I masking taped this baby up to help prevent any gray glue getting anywhere. I needed several hands for this, I was going to glue the edges on, and then also nail them in with really tiny nails.

![](prepping_gluing_edges.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Here she is with the edges üòç This was definitely the most stressful part of this build. It didn't take long but I was so worried about the gluing and nailing and not having the edges aligned perfectly, but thankfully it all worked out!

![](tabletop_edges_glued_and_nailed_in.jpg){fig-align="center"}

There was some issues, I didn't have any really big clamps to push the wood super close together, so there are gaps between the top and the edges, and some places you could see glue. I ended up picking out the gray glue later on and filling those edges with red oak wood filler before I stained. This helped A LOT. If I were to redo this, I would definitely get big clamps so those gaps wouldn't be there.

![](tabletop_edges_not_tight_enough_some_glue.jpg){fig-align="center"}

I also filled all the nails in with red oak wood filler before I stained as well.

![](tabletop_nailed_in.jpg){fig-align="center"}

## Staining the Tabletop

I obviously sanded the crap out of this before I stained. I LOVED how this stain turned out. I love the grain pattern for red oak wood, it is a pricier wood but it is just so beautiful.

![](first_stain.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Here is after the second stain.

![](second_stain.jpg){fig-align="center"}

I did some final touch ups with the red oak wood filler, did one more stain, and finished with polyurethane.

## Making the Logo

The logo is probably my favorite part. When I started dating my boyfriend (Liam) back in 2020, I told him I wanted to have my own brewery one day. He doodled up an amazing logo.

![](original_logo.JPG){fig-align="center"}

Four years later, he recreated it using Adobe Illustrator, and he conveniently works at a print shop and printed the logo directly on to aluminum dibond.

## Finishing Touches

Finally after the wood was done drying (I waited 1 week) I attached the tap tower. I then glued small wooden pieces to the front of the freezer. Then I took the circular stained piece of wood (Liam got everything cut into circles at his job, I didn't have a tool for that) and glued that onto the smaller pieces of wood to make it look elevated off the wood. I also know you're really not supposed to have anything covering a freezer, because it needs to release heat, so I didn't want the big circular piece of wood directly glued onto the freezer. Then I just glued the logo onto the piece of wood!

![](finished_product.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Finally I added LED lights underneath the lid to illuminate this masterpiece at night!

![](lights_installed.jpg){fig-align="center"}

Then I added all the keg elements into the freezer, along with attaching the Inkbird temperature controller to keep the freezer at usually around 34 degrees, I like a crisp cold beer üòé

And finally, at night üòè
