# Overview

I completed this project as part of a Project Management course in my Master's program. I uploaded the files to the file system hosted by VT, so this [link](https://people.cs.vt.edu/hannahl8/BIT4484/hokiehousinghub/base.html){style="color: rgb(55, 148, 255) !important; text-decoration: underline;"} is purely a static site.
