# Overview

I created this project for fun because my best friend was finally moving to the same city as me, and I hosted her and her boyfriend a welcome party! I created this website in just two weeks, and I am proud of it for having only learned Django in school one semester before. I haven't touched this project since then, but it's definitely a fun little personalized game (I kind of turned it into a drinking game LOL). Everyone enjoyed it, I love being able to do small things like this with my coding abilities!
